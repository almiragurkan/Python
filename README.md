# Python

In this project, I worked on a system for university placement exam.  I already have the following information related with this exam; student information,  their answers to questions, their choices of universities and university information.  There are 40 questions in the exam book and each question has five possible choices.  (a,b,c,d,e). 4 wrong answers will take away one of the correct ones. Every correct  answer is worth 15 points.
